# Sudan-Regions-and-Cities-GeoJSON

## Project Motivation

At the start of the ongoing war in Sudan I began learning to code. I wanted to build a heat map to visualize recovered regions and cities across Sudan, but I quickly discovered that reliable latitude and longitude data was hard to find. After spending many hours searching for accurate coordinates and GeoJSON sources, I decided to gather the datasets myself and share them here to make the process easier for everyone.

This repository contains GeoJSON exports of populated places (points) and regional polygons intended to support mapping, analysis, and visualization (for example, with Leaflet, QGIS, or Kepler.gl). My goal is to provide clean, usable location data that others can use to create heat maps and other visual tools that help better understand the situation on the ground.

The repository will be updated over time with additional data, corrections, and improvements. Contributions, issue reports, and suggested enhancements are very welcome — together we can make this dataset more complete and more accessible to researchers, mapmakers, and humanitarian actors.

Thank you for checking out the project. If you use this data or build visualizations from it, please consider sharing your work so others can benefit.
